In this assignment, let's consider our own world. Consequently, our data set comes from a site with that in mind!

You are going to use this dataset manifest to develop a dashboard on a particular area of interest using the principles of interactive visualization you learned in this topic (including previous learning practices).

Note: This is a very open-ended assignment and you will be assessed accordingly. 

Here's what you do: 

    Access the Our World in Data site. (https://ourworldindata.org/)
    Scroll to the research areas and find a data set. 
    Download and analyze the data set.
    Then, create an interactive data visualization using the principles learned in this topic.
        You will notice this is effectively the only requirement because there are so many possibilities. 
    Save the Tableau file as Tableau Package Worksheet (.twbx) with data.
